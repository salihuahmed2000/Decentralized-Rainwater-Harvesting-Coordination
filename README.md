# Decentralized Rainwater Harvesting Coordination

A blockchain-based platform enabling communities to optimize rainwater collection, monitoring, and sharing through transparent tracking, quality assurance, and collaborative distribution.

## Overview

This project addresses water security and sustainability challenges by creating a decentralized coordination system for community-based rainwater harvesting. By establishing a transparent framework for system registration, volume tracking, quality monitoring, and overflow sharing, the platform helps communities maximize the capture and effective use of rainwater resources.

The system uses smart contracts to create a trustworthy record of water collection, usage, quality, and sharing that empowers neighborhoods to build resilience against water scarcity while promoting efficient resource allocation.

## Core Components

### 1. System Registration Contract

Records and verifies rainwater harvesting installations:
- System specifications and capacity
- Collection surface area and material
- Storage tank details and location
- Filtration components
- Installation certification
- Ownership and maintenance responsibility
- System modifications and upgrades tracking

### 2. Volume Tracking Contract

Monitors water collection and usage patterns:
- Rainfall-to-collection efficiency metrics
- Storage levels and capacity utilization
- Usage volume by category (irrigation, household, etc.)
- Historical collection data and trends
- Seasonal variation analysis
- Conservation goal tracking
- Automated metering integration where available

### 3. Quality Testing Contract

Maintains records of water testing and treatment:
- Water quality test results and frequency
- Contaminant monitoring
- Treatment methods and schedule
- Safe usage classifications (potable, non-potable)
- pH and mineral content tracking
- Microbial testing results
- Certification for different use types

### 4. Overflow Sharing Contract

Manages the distribution of excess water to neighbors:
- Sharing agreements between system owners
- Automated notifications of available excess
- Distribution priority rules
- Transfer tracking and confirmation
- Reciprocity accounting
- Community water banking
- Emergency sharing protocols

## Benefits

- **For System Owners**: Optimizes collection efficiency, provides usage insights, ensures water quality, and facilitates community participation
- **For Communities**: Increases water security, reduces municipal water demand, mitigates stormwater runoff, and builds neighborhood resilience
- **For Environment**: Reduces energy used for water treatment, decreases impervious surface impacts, and supports sustainable water management

## Technical Implementation

- Built on [specify blockchain platform]
- Smart contracts written in [programming language]
- IoT integration for automated measurement
- Mobile app for system monitoring and management
- Weather data integration for collection forecasting

## Usage Examples

### Registering a Harvesting System
```javascript
// Example code for system registration
const systemRegistry = await SystemRegistry.deploy();
await systemRegistry.registerSystem(
  "0x123...", // System owner address
  {
    collectionArea: 120, // in square meters
    roofMaterial: "metal",
    storageCapacity: 5000, // in liters
    filterType: "first-flush diverter with sediment filter",
    installationDate: "2025-02-15",
    gpsCoordinates: {lat: 37.7749, lng: -122.4194},
    certifiedBy: "EcoWater Installations"
  }
);
```

### Recording Water Quality Test
```javascript
// Example code for quality testing
const qualityTracker = await QualityTracker.deploy();
const testId = await qualityTracker.recordTest(
  systemId,
  {
    testDate: "2025-03-10",
    pH: 6.8,
    turbidity: 1.2,
    bacteriaPresent: false,
    contaminants: [],
    treatmentApplied: "UV filtration",
    potabilityStatus: "safe for irrigation and household non-potable use",
    testedBy: "Community Water Lab"
  }
);
```

## Community Coordination Features

- **Neighborhood water mapping**: Visualizes collection capacity and sharing potential
- **Rainfall alerts**: Notifies users of upcoming collection opportunities
- **Sharing marketplace**: Facilitates water exchange between neighbors
- **Community metrics**: Tracks collective impact on water conservation
- **Knowledge base**: Shares best practices for system maintenance and water usage
- **Quality verification network**: Enables peer review of testing procedures

## Implementation Roadmap

- **Q2 2025**: Initial platform development with basic tracking capabilities
- **Q3 2025**: Mobile app development and IoT sensor integration
- **Q4 2025**: Quality testing verification system and sharing protocol implementation
- **Q1 2026**: Weather forecasting integration and advanced analytics

## Sustainability Impact Metrics
